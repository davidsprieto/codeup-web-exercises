        <dt>How many total national parks are there in the United States?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Currently there are 63 national parks in the United States. The nation park system includes 423 national park sites in total which includes memorials, national historic landmarks, heritage areas, etc.</dd>

        <dt>Which national parks are the best?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Every national park is worth visiting. But, particularly unique national parks due to their geography are the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, Zion, and Arches National Parks.</dd>

        <dt>Which national parks have the most visitors?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Popular national parks for overnight visitors are the Grand Canyon, Yosemite & Yellowstone. However, there are several national parks that are more popular for day visitors such the Great Smoky Mountains & Rocky Mountain National Parks.</dd>

        <dt>Which national parks have the most wildlife?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">All national parks have wildlife from snakes and birds to larger animals such as wolves, bears, moose and buffalo and even marine life. To see the most wildlife it is recommended to visit national parks that cover large forest areas such as Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Isle Royale, Rocky Mountain or Alaska’s Denali National Park.</dd>

        <dt>Do national parks have guided tours?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yes, each national park offers guided tours that can either be hosted by the National Park Service (NPS) or by certified guides. A large part of the National Park Service mission aims to educate visitors about the uniqueness of each different park and how to enjoy each park to its fullest.</dd>

        <dt>How many people visit national parks each year?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Last year, there were 327 million national park visits in the United States. Some national parks, like Zion, can become overcrowded during warmer months and require visitors to use park transportation rather than personal vehicles. Therefore, it is recommended to visit during the off-season months.</dd>

        <dt>Are there general rules when visiting a national park or does each park have specific ones?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Yes, there are general rules when visiting national parks and you will find this information on the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/lawsandpolicies.htm" target="_blank" >official national park website</a>. In addition, each national park has specific rules that can change seasonally. For example, campfire regulations may fluctuate depending on drought conditions and the risk of wildfires.</dd>

        <dt>Where can I find official park maps?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">We think the best way to utilize a complete map of all national parks on a map is to use the <a href="https://findyourpark.com/" target="_blank">Find Your Park</a> tool provided by the National Park Service website. Many national parks have digital, downloadable versions of park maps as well hard copies in visitor and welcome centers.</dd>

        <dt>How do I make reservations for camping or staying in national parks?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Most of the campsites in national parks and national forests are available on a first-come, first serve basis, but it is recommended travelers make <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/search?inventory_type=camping&inventory_type=dayuse" target="_blank">reservations online</a> whenever possible. It is recommended to make online reservations for popular national parks at least three to five months in advance.</dd>

        <dt>Can I drive into a national park and is there an entrance fee?</dt>
        <dd class="invisible">Most of the national parks in the United States are accessible by car, RV or bus. When you enter the park, you’ll need to pay an entrance fee, which is usually between $20-$40 per vehicle. Park passes can be valid for up to seven days depending on the park and season. If you plan to visit several national parks, we recommend you buy the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/planyourvisit/passes.htm" target="_blank">America the Beautiful Pass</a> for $80.</dd>
